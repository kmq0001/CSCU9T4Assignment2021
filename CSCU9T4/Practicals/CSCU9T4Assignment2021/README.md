# CSCU9T4Assignment2021
This repository holds the initial reduced code and test suite for the assignment of CSCU9T4 Managing Information. Refer to the assignment sheet for instructions.

The assignment sheet can be found under the Test_files folder

The test suite only contains an overview of the methods and classes that will be tested when marking not the actual test cases or boundary values. You are just expected to code according to the specifications and you are free to use/create as many or as few test cases as you like or see fit.

Most tests should fail by default until you change them and add actual test data to them.
The test class for RefBookChapter contains two tests that (although failing for now) demonstrate two simple, but fully functioning test cases.
